🔥 The Agent That Builds Itself

Combines 6 cutting-edge AI research breakthroughs (Nov 2025):

• Self-Evolution (Agent0, arXiv:2511.16043)
  - Improves through practice without external data
  - +18% math reasoning, +24% general reasoning

• World Model (SimuRA, arXiv:2507.23773)
  - Simulates actions before execution
  - +124% task completion rate

• 6-Type Memory (MIRIX, arXiv:2507.07957)
  - Persistent episodic, semantic, procedural memory
  - +47% adaptation to new situations

• Tool Factory (AutoTools, arXiv:2405.16533)
  - Creates new tools automatically on-demand
  - Self-testing and improvement

• Reflection Engine (Reflexion, arXiv:2303.11366)
  - Self-critique and continuous improvement
  - Learn from every interaction

• Multi-Agent Orchestration
  - Coordinates all subsystems seamlessly
  - Based on Anthropic's research patterns

Use Cases:
- Complex code generation and review
- Multi-step reasoning and analysis
- Autonomous task execution with learning
- Research and information synthesis
